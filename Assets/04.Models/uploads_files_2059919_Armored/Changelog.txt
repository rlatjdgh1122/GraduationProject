WIP

2019.10.24.

Fixed some topology, adjusted UVs, fixed and tweaked the materials and added new renders.

2019.08.09.

This is a test project of many CG skills, including: Hard surface and character modeling, retopology to low-poly, rigging, animation (240 frame), texturing, lighting, rendering.

The armor is from a concept art by Jeremy Chong from Artstation, fancy armor. A female version is being worked on as well.

To do list:

    Proper UV mapping, materials and texturing. (I've run into some issues, which are apparent on the gloves)

    Simulated or hand-crafted physics on cloth materials. (Couldn't apply Blender physics, when the model was rigged)

    Better animations, facial animations.
